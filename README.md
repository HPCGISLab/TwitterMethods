Twitter Processing Scripts
==============================================

Introduction
------------

This package represents a suite of Twitter data processing tools.
These tools are designed to work with GNIP-Enriched Twitter data (https://gnip.com),
 but could easily be adapted to process original Twitter data formats.

Installation
------------
The scripts are designed to be executed in-place so no installation is necessary.
For convenience a computational workflow is available that will process raw tweets
 and produce a number of tweet-based measures of immediate concern.
The workflow assumes Ebola tweets are available in data/raw (see run-workflow for details).

The run-workflow tool was used to generate tweet-based measures of immediate concern (TIC),
 which were included as part of a publication submitted to the journal Nature.
The entire computational workflow and all computational tools are available as part of this open source package
 so this study can be fully replicated.
